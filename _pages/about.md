*First things first* - my first name is pronounced "nee-cha." 

I am a new assistant professor in the Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging at the Yale School of Medicine. I develop algorithms for medical image processing and analysis. My [current work](https://hellonicha.github.io/projects/) focuses on applications of deep learning for learning from functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

I am a biomedical engineer by training, from my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins to my PhD research under [James S. Duncan](https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/people/james_duncan-1.profile) at Yale.
