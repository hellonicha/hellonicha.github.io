*First things first* - my first name is pronounced "nee-cha." The C in my middle name stands for Chitphakdithai, pronounced "jit-puck-tie." You will find my older publications under this name.

I am a new assistant professor in the Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging at the Yale School of Medicine, with a secondary appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Yale School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I develop algorithms for medical image processing and analysis. My [current work](https://hellonicha.github.io/projects/) focuses on applications of deep learning for analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

I am a biomedical engineer by training, from my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins to my PhD research under [James S. Duncan](https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/people/james_duncan-1.profile) at Yale. In my research, I have utilized techniques spanning from Bayesian inference to modern machine learning. Biomedical applications of my work have varied from [registration of brain images](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-15705-9_45.pdf), to [particle reconstruction for cryo-electron microscopy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847715000714), to [functional neuroimage analysis](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-67389-9_42.pdf) and [neuroprediction](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-00931-1_38.pdf).
