*First things first* - my first name is pronounced "nee-cha." The _C_ in my middle name stands for _Chitphakdithai_, pronounced "jit-puck-tie." You will find some of my older publications under this name.

I am a new assistant professor in the Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging at the Yale School of Medicine. I develop algorithms for medical image processing and analysis. My [current work](https://hellonicha.github.io/projects/) focuses on applications of deep learning for learning from functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

I am a biomedical engineer by training, from my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins to my PhD research under [James S. Duncan](https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/people/james_duncan-1.profile) at Yale. In my research, I have utilized techniques spanning from Bayesian inference to modern machine learning. Biomedical applications of my work have varied from registration of brain images, to particle reconstruction for cryo-electron microscopy, to functional neuroimage analysis and neuroprediction.
