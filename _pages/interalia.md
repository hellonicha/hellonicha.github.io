Among other things...

## Current/recent reading list
- _The Exceptions: Nancy Hopkins, MIT, and the Fight for Women in Science_ by Kate Zernicke
    - Truly shocking how not-long-ago the events described occurred, that they even did occur, and also how much in this book still resonates with today.
- _Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking_ by Susan Cain
    - Hoping to feel some inspiration / encouragement from this book as an introverted human.
- _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ by J.K. Rowling
    - Need to keep up with my 8 year old.
