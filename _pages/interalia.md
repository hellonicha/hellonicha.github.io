Among other things...

## Current/recent reading list

    - Truly shocking how not-long-ago the events described occurred, that they even did occur, and also how much in this book still resonates with today. 
- _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ by J.K. Rowling
    - Need to read to keep up with my 8 year old.
